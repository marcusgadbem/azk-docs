# Terms of Use

This document describes how Azuki will treat the data provided by individuals that have agreed to share their usage information through the **azk** command-line tool.

## How we collect data

With your permission, **azk** will transmit your usage data to Azuki. The first time you attempt to execute **azk**, version 0.12.0 or above, you will be requested to grant permission of transmission. If you decline the request, **azk** will not collect or send any data, until you decide to re-enable it. If you grant permission, **azk** will collect and transmit data for the information listed below. Since **azk** is open-source, you can also find all the code responsible for sending usage data in the source code.

After providing your initial permission, you may discontinue to transmit data by disabling it in the command-line tool using the "track" option.

## Which data is collected

We collect different kinds of information, non-identifying or aggregated. Here are the types of information we collect or receive:

**azk usage information:** This is information about which commands, **azk** version, Docker version, usage of Docker image or Dockerfile, and Docker image repository name you use.

**Hardware information:** In addition to **azk** usage information, we may also collect information about the hardware in which you’re using **azk**, including what operating system you’re using, your CPU model, its total number of cores,  your processor architecture, and total RAM memory. In case the Operating System is a Mac OS X, we also collect information from the virtual machine, total number of cores, and total RAM memory.

**Geo-location information:** IP address received from your computer may be used to determine approximate location.

## How we use your information

**Understanding and improving azk:** To make **azk** better we have to understand how users are using it. We intend to use the data we collect in many different ways to improve our products, including research.
