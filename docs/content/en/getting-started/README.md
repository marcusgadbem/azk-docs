# Getting started

Before you begin, make sure you have [azk installed](../installation/README.md).

This guide will walk you through the first steps with `azk`, demonstrating the basics of its main features.

## Sample project

For your convenience we have a [sample project](https://github.com/azukiapp/azkdemo). It is relatively simple, but you can use it to test and understand the main features of `azk`.

There are two ways to get a copy of the project:

*By cloning the repository:*

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/azukiapp/azkdemo
```

*By downloading the project as a compressed file:*

```sh
$ curl -L https://github.com/azukiapp/azkdemo/archive/master.zip -o azkdemo.zip
$ unzip azkdemo.zip
$ mv azkdemo-master azkdemo
```

> ** Note **: All commands `cd [path_demo]/azkdemo` in this guide, take into account that `[path_demo]/` is the path where the file above was extracted, be careful to always point to the correct path. ;)
