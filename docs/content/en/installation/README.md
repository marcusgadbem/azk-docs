# Installation

Installing `azk` is really simple and it has packages available for both [Linux](linux.md) and [Mac OS X](mac_os_x.md).

The installation process will add the `azk` command to your system path, making it available in your terminal application.

- [Mac OS X](mac_os_x.md)
- [Linux](linux.md)
- [Source code](source-code.md)
- [Upgrading](upgrading.md)
