# Starting an application from scratch

Let's say you want to start a new project using a language or framework that you don't have installed in your machine. How do you do that?

One of the advantages of using `azk` is that we don't need a development environment previously installed. For that, `azk` has a few tools that can help when starting a new project from scratch. The following examples show how to start a project using `azk` for some popular languages and frameworks:

- [Node.js](nodejs.md)
- PHP
  - [Laravel](php-laravel.md)
  - [Wordpress + phpMyAdmin + MySQL](php-wordpress-phpmyadmin.md)
- Python
  - [Django](python-django.html#python-with-django)
- Ruby
  - [Ruby on Rails + MySQL](ruby-rails.md)
