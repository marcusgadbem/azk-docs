# About

`azk` is an orchestration tool for development environments that through a manifest file (the Azkfile.js) helps the developer to quickly: install, configure and run commonly used tools for developing web applications with different open source technologies.

All this in a transparent and easily manageable way. Thanks to the container system used in the implementation of each application and its dependencies, everything is isolated and you can easily remove and recreate the environments of each application without any side effects or loss of performance, as would happen with the use of virtual machines for the same purpose.
