## command

Command that will always run when the system starts. If not set, the default command ([CMD](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#cmd)) of the image is performed.

#### Usage:

```js
command: 'COMMAND_GOES_HERE',
```

##### Examples:

In a __node.js__ application it would be interesting to run `npm start` to start the web server.

```js
command: 'npm start',
```

In turn, in __rails__, we would start with `rackup config.ru`.

```js
command: 'bundle exec rackup config.ru --port $HTTP_PORT',
```
